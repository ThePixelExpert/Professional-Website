## Archived Files (September 21, 2025)

## Current Documentation

Use these active documentation files instead:

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
- **[INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md](../INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md)** - Complete infrastructure documentation  
- **[QUICK_REFERENCE.md](../QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Daily operations commands
- **[CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SETUP.md](../CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SETUP.md)** - Registry configuration
- **[PIHOLE_MONITORING_SETUP.md](../PIHOLE_MONITORING_SETUP.md)** - Pi-hole monitoring integration

## Reason for Archiving

These files contained overlapping information and outdated procedures. The current infrastructure uses:

1. **Ansible automation** instead of manual deployments
2. **Container registry** instead of manual image distribution  
3. **Consolidated documentation** instead of multiple scattered guides

All essential information has been preserved in the current documentation structure.
